 1. Program to implement Stack operations ( push, pop and Display). 

 2. Program to print all the solutions of a quadratic equation. 

 3. Program to read student’s name, regno, marks and display the student details with total marks, using single and multilevel inheritance. 

 4. a)Program to implement Queue operations ( insert, delete and display). 
    b)Program to read two integers, perform division of two numbers, display the result with appropriate messages using the concept of Exception Handling.
    
 5. Implement different String Operations(strcpy, strlength, strcat, strcmp, str.charAt(i)) using method overloading. 

 6. Program to multiply given two matrices of size mxn. 

 7. a)Program to count the frequency of words. (using String Tokenizer) 
    b)Program to read N values using an array and sort them using Bubble Sort.
    
 8. Program to perform addition, subtraction, division and multiplication of complex numbers. (use method overloading) 

 9. Program to find the values of unknowns in the polynomial degree of n. 

 10. Program to create threads A,B and C for three different tasks using Thread class with a thread for main method. 

 11. Program to overload the function search() to search an integer key value and key value of type double using Binary Search. 

 12. Applet program that automatically display the text with Font style, Font type using getParameter(), getCodeBase() and getDocumentBase().

 13. Create two classes ‘Teacher’ and ‘Student’. Perform interfacing of classes with appropriate attributes. 

 14. Develop an Applet that receives an integer in one text field and computes it’s factorial value and returns it in another text field, when the button named “computes” is clicked. 

 Note: The evaluation is based on any one program from the list of programs.
