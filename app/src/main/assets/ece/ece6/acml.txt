Analog Communication and Microwave Lab 

Analog communication experiments: 

1. Design and testing of Butterworth second order active filters –LPF, HPF, BPF, BEF 

2. Constant K, T and π type filters – LPF,HPF, BPF, BEF 

3. AM generation and detection 

4. FM generation and detection 

5. DSBSC/SSB generation and detection 


Microwave Experiments: 

1. Mode curves of Microwave sources (Gunn/Klystron) 

2. Measurement of Frequency and VSWR 

3. Measurement of unknown impedance (use slotted lines and Smith chart) 

4. Experiments on directional couplers 

5. Experiments on magic Tee. 

6. Measurements of Antenna parameters (may be of Hon antenna) 


Study of Radio Receiver and Transmitter Characteristics.
