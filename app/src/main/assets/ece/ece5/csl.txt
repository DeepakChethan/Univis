Circuit Simulation Lab 

I. Using pspice or equivalent simulation software 

1. Power supply design: series voltage regulator (with preamplifier). 

2. Switching regulator 

3. Feedback amplifier: voltage series, current series 

4. Filters: active filters (second order) 

5. Combinational circuits: Mux and its applications, adders and its applications, Demux/decoder, Encoder. 

6. Design of countrs/shift registers and their applications. 

7. Experiments with 555 timer (Astable, monostable) 

8. D/A Converters and A/D converters 

9. FSK generation. 


II. Using Model Sim (upto synthesis and functional simulation)

(i) Structural 
(ii) Behavioral 
(iii) Data flow model. 

b) Modeling of Latches and Flip flops 
(i) D flip-flop 
(ii) SR flip-flop 
(iii) JK flip-flop 
(iv) T flip-flop.
